# 📝 Tasks

1. Create a **new** `Restaurant` interface with fields matching the `RestaurantDTO` from the Java project. Extend the `RestaurantDTO` with new arbitrary fields.
2. If the restaurant has **fewer** than 3 stars, use the original `RestaurantDTO` from the preparation. If the restaurant has **more** than 3 stars, use the new DTO defined in Task 1.
3. Implement **sorting** functionality for restaurants (ascending/descending).
4. Include a `text field` that allows **filtering** of the restaurant table.
