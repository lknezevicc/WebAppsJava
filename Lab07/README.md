## 🛠️ Environment Note

Before starting the Spring project, make sure to download [Apache Maven 4.0.0 RC2](https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-4/4.0.0-rc-2/binaries/).  
After downloading, extract the archive and run the following command to build the project and allow MapStruct to generate necessary code:

```bash
/path/to/apache-maven-4.0.0-rc-2/bin/mvn clean package
````

📌 Replace /path/to/ with the actual path where you extracted Maven.
